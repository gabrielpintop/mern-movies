### Steps for running the app locally

0) Clone or download the repository.
1) Run MongoDB. Enter to the the place where MongoDB was installed using the CMD, and run "mongod" (it is typically on the bin folder), make sure it is connected to the port 27017.
2) Open the root foled on a CMD.
3) Run "npm install" and then "npm start". The back server runs on http://localhost:8080
